# Shortest_Path_Algorithm
It is just a simple program to know the shortest path mathematically between two specified points while the obstructions have been given.

First point on mouse click will specify the point at which the algorithm will start
Second point on mouse click will specify the point at which the algorithm will end
Third point will be black colored and will specify the obstructions and you can put as many as you can

You can also change the number of cells in code to increase the complexity.
